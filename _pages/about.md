Hello, I am a senior undergraduate student studying Mechanical Engineering and Psychology at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu), advised by [Shreyas Kousik](https://www.shreyaskousik.com/). Previously, I worked in [GTRI](https://gtri.gatech.edu/) [Electronic Systems Laboratory](https://www.gtri.gatech.edu/laboratories/electronic-systems-laboratory)[,](https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/) [SightWise](https://sightwise.co/) (a startup), and [Asan Medical Center](https://bmerc.amc.seoul.kr). 

My passion lies in devising novel information representations to enable efficient computations and intuitive human experiences. In specific, I seek to work on:

1. Applying computational approaches to new domains
    - including traditional sciences, unobservable or subjective phenomena, etc.
2. Utilizing joint information representations and test-time input augmentations to extend the capabilities of large transformer models (e.g., LLM)
3. Devising human-centered communication and control schemes by considering human perceptual, cognitive, and motor characteristics
4. Utilizing large-scale unlabeled data (e.g., videos) for weak self-supervised learning of joint/multimodal information representations
    - including value functions, world state perception and prediction, etc.

My life goal is to tackle underserved problems (e.g., affordable and useful assistive technology devices) and create solutions that directly improve the quality of lives of individuals.
